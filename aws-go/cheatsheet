TIPS and TRICKS
- if you revise the script, you can build via 'go build <script_name>'
- set --workers to 250 so sessions don't time out
- write output to >> output.txt file and use tail -f to watch progress
- set putty Connection setting to send keepaives so connection doesn't time out
- set `ulimit -n 1048576'
  useful comands: ulimit -a , ulimit -Hn
* use aws s3api get-bucket-policy command to find buckets with bucket policies
- use the Dashboard and/or aws s3 get-bucket-policy-status to find public buckets
- add buckets that are public or have bucket policies to blacklist so we don't scan
- use vim replace and delete lines trick to quickly copy/paste list to script



To increase up to the hard limit, you can run: "ulimit -Sn 4096" (to find out the hard limit you can run "uli
mit -Hn"). If I recall correctly, though, even 4,096 wasn't enough. I ended up increasing my hard limit to so
mething crazy like 1,048,576. To increase the hard limit you'll have to modify /etc/security/limits.conf.
